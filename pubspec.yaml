# * Something common is to manage versions using 3 numbers: X.Y.Z and each one indicates a different thing:
# * The first (X) is known as the major version and indicates the main version of the software.
# * Example: 1.0.0, 3.0.0
# * The second (Y) is known as a minor version and indicates new functionalities.
# * Example: 1.2.0, 3.3.0
# * The third (Z) is known as a patch and indicates that a code review was carried out due to some error.
# * Example: 1.2.2, 3.3.4
# ! Now that we know the meaning of each number, an important question comes: how do we know when to change them and which to change?
# ? Major version or X:
# * when we add new important functionalities, it can be as a new module or key feature for the functionality.
# ? Minor version or Y:
# * when we make minor corrections, when we fix a bug and add functionality that is not crucial to the project.
# ? Patch or Z:
# * every time we deliver the project.

version: 0.0.1+1 # ? (x.y.z)  => version app + (b) => build app
# * Whenever a compilation is generated (apk, bundle, ipa...etc) the build number must be increased by 1.
